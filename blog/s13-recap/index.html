The reason is simple: I haven&#x27;t been playing much.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Playing League solo takes a toll on your mental, and it became unbearable in recent years. The saddest part to me is that gameplay-wise I still love this game so much, but the player interaction part makes playing it painful.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold" id="League-still-has-great-gameplay"><span>League still has great gameplay</span></h2></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>I played some Heroes of the Storm with my buddies last year.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>All of us agreed that Heroes was not fun.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Based on the design and the idea, it should be fun, but it really isn&#x27;t. Every move or attack feels bland in Heroes, and those are the most basic and important things in a MOBA. They stack up, and the game lacks satisfying feedback thus feels boring.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>League, on the other hand, feels great to play. When the player does something right, be it last-hitting, kill, or smite win, the game makes sure to make the player know it by providing awesome feedback.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>After playing it for more than a decade, it is easy to focus on the part that stands out when talking about League contents, like the collective 200 years of design experience. But I felt it is necessary and important to appreciate the parts Leagues are doing great and not take it for granted. It is the most popular game in the world for a reason.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold" id="Taiwan-Server"><span>Taiwan Server</span></h2></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Taiwan server left Garena and becomes almost directly managed by Riot this year. This is the second biggest event in the history of Taiwan server. The biggest one was the start of the old server ten years ago.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Me and my buddies who played ranked 5v5 in season 2 all were excited, and we assembled again after eleven years. A bunch of adults in their 30s gather at night or weekend to practice and talk about a game seriously, and we had a blast.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>People are still dumb and toxic, but at least it is easier to cope with each other. League really is meant to be played with friends.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold" id="Switching-to-mid-lane"><span>Switching to mid lane</span></h2></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Lately I started playing mid lane again. It started with Akali.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>I fell in love with Akali, not lore wise, but gameplay wise. It is a mechanic-demanding champion, but when played right she is the most bad ass champion in the game.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Being in my 30s with a full time job, I didn&#x27;t expect myself to make Bjerg level play with her, but after some games I did have some plays I&#x27;m pretty happy with.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Is playing Akali the most optimal way to win for me? Definitely not.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>But is it fun? Oh boy did I have fun when I chase and kill those helpless AD carries in one rotation.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>And during these Akali games I realized how much bigger the agency a mid laner has than a bot laner. As a mid laner you are able to impact the game so much so early, which is a feeling I haven&#x27;t had for more than ten years.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>When the disadvantages grow and situation becomes dire, what can you do as an AD carry? If my ID was Ruler maybe I can assassinate their carry and get away with it, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t. I was merely an egg in a ramen. If the ramen is already rotten before 15 minutes, an egg is not going to make it edible. Let alone I&#x27;m not even a particularly good egg.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>As a mid laner I have more tools to make play that may impact the game. One time I found their jungler and invaded him when he was still level 2. He was tilted and the game was over at that point. Another time when the enemy team was sieging after a successful team fight, I TP flanked and killed their Caitlyn. Such thing would not happen if I was an AD carry.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>I don&#x27;t usually win lane and snowball to win, but with my buddies I can play a more pivotal and supportive role with champions like Galio, trying to win games with not brawn but brain.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Then after we got our first win of the day I can int with Akali.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold" id="About-Akali"><span>About Akali</span></h2></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><h3 class="mt-8 text-xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold" id="Pros"><span>Pros</span></h3></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><ul class="list-disc list-inside mx-8"><li><span>Extremely high mobility, good chasing and escaping capability</span></li><li><span>Shroud creates confusion and space in fight</span></li><li></li></ul></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><h3 class="mt-8 text-xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold" id="Cons"><span>Cons</span></h3></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><ul class="list-disc list-inside mx-8"><li><span>mechanically demanding</span></li><li><span>not the best side lane champion</span></li></ul></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold" id="Esports"><span>Esports</span></h2></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>After the announcement of TSM selling their LCS spot, I stopped caring about LCS. To be honest I haven&#x27;t for a while, I was just waiting for the last straw.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Instead I was rooting for Dplus KIA, or more precisely, ShowMaker. I love someone with a personality. DK official YouTube channel contents being hilarious also helped. I recognised the jewel of the famous K&#x27;Sante monologue before it was viral.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Unfortunately DK wasn’t playing good. They were in worlds nonetheless, but anyone wouldn&#x27;t have any expectation after seen their play.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Last worlds had good narrative though, with the T1 storyline. Though I have great respect to Faker, I was never particularly a T1 fan. But after witnessing their championship, I was really happy and the emotion lingered for days.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>Faker is unarguably the GOAT of League, but he hasn&#x27;t won a championship for six years. It&#x27;s about time.</span></div><div class="mb-6 font-serif text-lg lg:text-xl lg:leading-8 last:mb-0"><span>And for those young prodigies, it would be such a tragedy if they fall short again, and such a catastrophe waste for such talents to be labeled chokers. I loved the redemption story, for all of them.</span></div></div><div class="flex-col justify-between hidden lg:flex"><div class="flex flex-col gap-fb5"><div><div class="text-fb3 py-fb1 mb-fb3 border-t border-b border-color text-center font-noto-sans font-extralight">TABLE OF CONTENT</div><ul class="ml-fb3 list-outside list-disc interactive-list-color"><li class="mt-fb2"><a class="font-serif text-fb3 leading-none interactive-color" href="/blog/s13-recap/#League-still-has-great-gameplay">League still has great gameplay</a></li><li class="mt-fb2"><a class="font-serif text-fb3 leading-none interactive-color" href="/blog/s13-recap/#Taiwan-Server">Taiwan Server</a></li><li class="mt-fb2"><a class="font-serif text-fb3 leading-none interactive-color" href="/blog/s13-recap/#Switching-to-mid-lane">Switching to mid lane</a></li><li class="mt-fb2"><a class="font-serif text-fb3 leading-none interactive-color" href="/blog/s13-recap/#About-Akali">About Akali</a></li><li class="mt-fb2"><div class="w-fb2"></div><a class="font-serif text-fb3 leading-none interactive-color" href="/blog/s13-recap/#Pros">Pros</a></li><li class="mt-fb2"><div class="w-fb2"></div><a class="font-serif text-fb3 leading-none interactive-color" href="/blog/s13-recap/#Cons">Cons</a></li><li class="mt-fb2"><a class="font-serif text-fb3 leading-none interactive-color" href="/blog/s13-recap/#Esports">Esports</a></li></ul></div><div><div class="text-fb3 py-fb1 mb-fb3 border-t border-b border-color text-center font-noto-sans font-extralight">ARCHIVE</div><div class="flex flex-col gap-fb3"><a class=" flex flex-col gap-fb1 interactive-color pb-fb2 border-b border-color last-of-type:border-none last-of-type:pb-0 lg:pb-0 lg:border-none " href="/blog/a-peek-of-the-world/"><div class="text-fb5 lg:text-fb3 font-abril leading-none text-wrap-balance">A Peek of the World</div><div class="text-fb3 lg:text-fb3 font-gentium-basic leading-none">I went to Copenhagen and London for my honeymoon, the first trip to Europe in my life.
