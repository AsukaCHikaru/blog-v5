Every move or attack feels bland in Heroes, and those are the most basic and important things in a MOBA. They stack up, and the game lacks satisfying feedback thus feels boring."}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"League, on the other hand, feels great to play. When the player does something right, be it last-hitting, kill, or smite win, the game makes sure to make the player know it by providing awesome feedback."}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"After playing it for more than a decade, it is easy to focus on the part that stands out when talking about League contents, like the collective 200 years of design experience. But I felt it is necessary and important to appreciate the parts Leagues are doing great and not take it for granted. It is the most popular game in the world for a reason."}]},{"type":"heading","level":1,"body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"Taiwan Server"}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"Taiwan server left Garena and becomes almost directly managed by Riot this year.

As a mid laner you are able to impact the game so much so early, which is a feeling I haven't had for more than ten years."}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"When the disadvantages grow and situation becomes dire, what can you do as an AD carry? If my ID was Ruler maybe I can assassinate their carry and get away with it, but unfortunately it wasn't. I was merely an egg in a ramen. If the ramen is already rotten before 15 minutes, an egg is not going to make it edible. Let alone I'm not even a particularly good egg."}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"As a mid laner I have more tools to make play that may impact the game. One time I found their jungler and invaded him when he was still level 2. He was tilted and the game was over at that point. Another time when the enemy team was sieging after a successful team fight, I TP flanked and killed their Caitlyn. Such thing would not happen if I was an AD carry."}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"I don't usually win lane and snowball to win, but with my buddies I can play a more pivotal and supportive role with champions like Galio, trying to win games with not brawn but brain."}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"Then after we got our first win of the day I can int with Akali."}]},{"type":"heading","level":1,"body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"Esports"}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"After the announcement of TSM selling their LCS spot, I stopped caring about LCS.

They were in worlds nonetheless, but anyone wouldn't have any expectation after seen their play."}]},{"type":"paragraph","body":[{"type":"textBody","style":"plain","value":"Last worlds had good narrative though, with the T1 storyline.
