Been researching and replaying Diablo II for the game I'm currently making.
The more I know about Diablo II the more I appreciate and love it.
I've never been a heavy D2 player, maybe I should be, after being 20 years late.

Been burnt out for a month, the second I got over with this task I started being productive, ain't no way this was a coincidence.

Back to Figma for my blog's next redesign. Goddamn Figma is incredible to use, does so much while demands so little efforts. Oh and now that Figma is not acquired by Adobe anymore, I guess subscribe to Figma is an option again?

My new phone’s battery level does not drop at all, it’s mind blowing compared to my previous phone, a three and half year old Pixel 4. Battery life was the reason I changed phone so there should be expectations, but two weeks in and I’m still very impressed.

After a hiatus of four months, I finally gathered enough motivation to try to be productive again.

Embed note heading in Obsidian.md does not show the note's title, and I'm annoyed by it so much that I decided to build a plugin for it. How hard could it be?

Finally realized that [DisplayFusion](https://www.displayfusion.com/) doesn't work well with windows 10 task view feature, at lease on my machine. Task view has always been a pain in the butt for me, every time I (unintentionally) activate it the desktop freezes. I thought it was windows build quality, turns out it was a compatibility issue. Now I get to utilize the task view feature, hope it helps my productivity.

Started trying photography. After walking around carrying a camera for a day, I found that trying to take photos made me paying more attention to my surroundings.
