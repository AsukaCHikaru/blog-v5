Of course, as such a fan of traditional sports and esports, I sometimes dream of teammates I can rely on to play with, to fully enjoy fighting, communicating, and competing with companions."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"However, as I live in a foreign country for years, the difficulty of getting a team or even friends to play with is greater. Let alone who would want to create a team for a silver/ gold guy? Like for players lower than diamond/ master, you don't even qualify to compete. And clash is precisely the answer to that."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"With clash you can easily enjoy a tournament with a clear format and schedule, and everyone can join.

We could talk about flex picks and champion pools and coordinate each other for an organized team fight.
