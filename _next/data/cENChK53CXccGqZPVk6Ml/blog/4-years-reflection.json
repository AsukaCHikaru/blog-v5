Even for something small, a proof of concept for example, game development is a months-long time-consuming process. During the time I can't invest time in other activities, including things I love like playing games. It leads to the conflict between the thoughts of \"I should be responsible for my own dream\" and \"I wish to enjoy other aspects of my life\", which takes a toll on my mental every day, eventually affecting my productivities at work."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"My new plan is to focus on day job, at least for now. If I find enough financial independence, then I will focus on my dream. This will be a decade-long process, but it seems more feasible than betting on me burning the candle at both ends."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"I reckon this plan works with my current employee. Due to reorganization, starting from April I'm changing department, somewhere I wanted since four years ago. Practically my responsibilities stay the same, but I still take it as an optimistic milestone.

I'm not the most talented developer in the team and I know it, the best way to live with that is to be humble.

I used to jump right into Figma after blunt outline of the first idea emerges in my head, bearing the wishful thinking of if I blindly tinker enough I will hit the sweet spot somehow. Now I do research after research, asking myself what direction am I aiming, what goal am I pursuing, before committing anything."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"And research is fun.
