CD PROJEKT RED also helped shaping the narrative by releasing teasers and trailers full of crazy promises. Then, Keanu Reeves was announced to perform as the lead character. There were several delay announcements, which brought some disappointments, but some other took that as a good thing, with expectations of delay means better quality of the final product."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"I beat the game in ten days. Probably because my expectations for the game were much lower, I did not feel as disappointed as the community did. I enjoyed my time in Night City, and I liked the emotions the nomad ending brought to me. But the game was far, far from what it was promised. Some people implied there was malice behind the broken promises, but I thought the developer simply bit off more than what they could chew, and—to be honest—I thought the game would never meet the expectations; the hype was out of control, no matter what state the game was in, it would have collapsed on its own weight all the same."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Either way, my faith in CDPR was not answered."}]},{"type":"heading","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Back to Night City"}],"depth":1},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Exactly four years after its initial release, I started replaying the game.

I heard it was very good, so I gave it a try."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Aside from choosing a different character origin and build, I took a different approach this time: no fast travel at all. That means no travel points, no skip rides, and no skips on metro rides. To me, the most impressive part of the game was the city, thus roaming through the city, either by car or by foot, was the proper way to experience it. The Night City's aesthetics were already breathtaking, and given the magnitude, I could not imagine how much work CDPR put in. Six districts, seventeen sub-districts, each has different atmospheres. I also noticed that there was more traffic on the street compared than in 1.0, both pedestrians and vehicles. One of the criticisms against the original game was that the city did not feel like a metropolis due to the quantity of traffic; now the amount of the traffic even annoys me sometimes."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"The NPCs' behavior, however, was not as impressive. Some cars were still stopping in the middle of the street for no reason. A good portion of the game consisted of dialogues on a fixed seat, but the animations and transitions between them were clunky. Then there were position or collision glitches. Most of these issues were minor, but they did reduced some of the immersion."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"I chose a different ending from my first playthrough, and I enjoyed it, as I also did four years ago.

The sequence of escaping with the president and the boss fight were cool, but it was not until the dialogue between the president and Solomon Reed, the character performed by acclaimed actor Idris Elba, that I started to notice: the animation and general dialogue performance felt... better? Like the NPCs were interacting with each other and with the surroundings, which was not seen in the main game, where characters stood still with minor gestures.

The streets were dirtier, more things were happening in the middle of the road, which immensely conveyed the chaos and tension of a warlord-controlled district inside a foreign territory. The missions were better too: in the main game, gigs and side quests, unless involved certain characters, were one-off go-where-kill-how-much quests, without proper buildup or follow-up. In the expansion even gigs included multiple steps which occurred in different locations, and NPCs sent texts even after the whole quest was wrapped. All these details successfully built the feeling that players were not merely checking off some question marks on the map, but actually attended those events personally."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"The best part of the quests, however, were undoubtedly the main quest, the story of "},{"type":"italic","text":"Songbird"},{"type":"plain","text":". Gameplay-wise the quest line included many type of stages, such as snipping, stealth, dialogue-heavy spying, and of course, combats. In the quest before the last confrontation out of two distinctly different paths, the game even turned into a survivor-horror game. Horror is not my favorite genre, so I wouldn't say I enjoyed it, but I appreciate that the developers respected player and made the horror gameplay decently challenging. During the main quests I kept thinking it felt like the Konpeki Plaza heist quest, only longer, more complex, and overall more interesting to play.

Before writing this review, I rewatched the trailers CDPR released before the main game was published, and the promise of Night City shown, even after four years of upgrades, was so much more than what it was in reality. Since CDPR had previously announced that there won't be another expansion, it is a matter of fact that, at lease in the game of Cyberpunk 2077, that promise has been broken. Some people are upset about it—rightfully so—but I just felt it was such a shame, because that promise seemed to be a hell of a game."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"But, with all of the work put into Phantom Liberty, in my eyes CD PROJECT RED has already redeemed themselves over the broken promise.
