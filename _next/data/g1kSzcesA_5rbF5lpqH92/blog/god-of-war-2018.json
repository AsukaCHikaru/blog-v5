The line “He’s beaten, father... not a threat.” at the end of the game demonstrates his development through the journey. Loved the moment."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"As for Kratos, the conflicts between his ideal and reality were well portrayed. I haven’t played any of the previous God of War games, but it’s evident that Kratos struggles to be the person he wants to be. The anticipation for the reunion with Chaos Blade was palpable; even I felt the weight, and connection to his legacy."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"In addition, you can clearly see his character growth throughout the game.
