Worst-case scenario, I play a good game which isn’t my favorite."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"My first impression after playing Hades was that the control is great.

In order to speak with his birth mother for a short time, he can only keep escaping."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Meanwhile, conversations with every character change based on the outcome of the earlier escapes.

A well-designed roguelike should be reasonably challenging; players can learn about the game through the obstacles until they understand the game enough to complete it."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"The permanent character progression, on the other hand, is the opposite idea; every earned resource reduces the difficulty. Even if the game is too hard for some players, they should be able to finish the game eventually with enough time and energy."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"The golden cross of decreased difficulty via player experience and character power scaling is the problem game designers must confront and solve. Postponing the golden cross by increasing the default difficulty is not ideal, the learning curve would be too steep, and people may quit; lowering the efficiency of character progress must also be executed carefully, with the risk of the progress mechanism becoming irrelevant."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Supergiant Games’ answer to the problem is configurable difficulty.
