To be able to climb every visible mountain in the world is cool, but neither the treasure hidden beneath nor the excitement of finding it was seductive enough for me.

The system is unchanged; all secrets in BOTW are still there; Nintendo simply added more contents to the world: wells, dungeons, worker who can't figure out how to tie a pillar, and tired Koroks (I never bothered). On top of that, they added two whole-sized regions: the Depths, and the Sky."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"The Depths, where players can't see through boundless darkness, is the highlight of TOTK's game design.

What happens when there is no interesting landscape? They lose the drive to enjoy the game's main content. It was what happened to me. I reckon most players unlocked every Sheikah Tower, but only a few of them discovered every hidden Koroks."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Players will consume content that has their attention to scratch the itch.

Controller vibrates when a shrine is near. Both are great at drawing players' attention."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Back to the Depths. By the nature of darkness, everything that glows draws attention. So Nintendo made the Lightroots the most noticeable target, and by unlocking them, players are granted a great sense of safety, along with a starting point to the next destination."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"The reward of exploration is the ability for further exploration. An elegant self-enhancing feedback loop. The greatest one in the game."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"Nintendo didn't stop there.

I think they nailed it in this game, and for that, TOTK is a better game to me. It is an improved version of an already exceptional foundation. An improved greatness."}]}],"postMetadata":{"id":"improving-greatness","title":"Improving Greatness","description":"Breath of the Wild is one of the most impactful game in last decade.
