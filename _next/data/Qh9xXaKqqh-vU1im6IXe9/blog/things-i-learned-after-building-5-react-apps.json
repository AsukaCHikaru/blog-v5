I will say, during the starting of my time with React, I struggled a lot. To understand React, I have to have basic knowledge of, for example, the concept of Webpack (and the overwhelming config docs), virtual dom, JSX, state machine... all were new things to me. Fortunately, I got some advice from seniors, then I felt like I was finally on the right way of learning React for the first time.
