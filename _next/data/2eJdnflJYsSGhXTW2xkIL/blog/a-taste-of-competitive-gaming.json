Of course, as such a fan of traditional sports and esports, I sometimes dream of teammates I can rely on to play with, to fully enjoy fighting, communicating, and competing with companions."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"However, as I live in a foreign country for years, the difficulty of getting a team or even friends to play with is greater. Let alone who would want to create a team for a silver/ gold guy? Like for players lower than diamond/ master, you don't even qualify to compete. And clash is precisely the answer to that."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"With clash you can easily enjoy a tournament with a clear format and schedule, and everyone can join. The low threshold makes teams willing to embrace temporary teammates, to match the minimum requirement of entering clash, which is to find five players."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"I enjoyed it a lot. We could talk about flex picks and champion pools and coordinate each other for an organized team fight. There were no flaming or passive-aggressive comments, only information and cheers."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"The best part is, I had the best performance in months, if not years. I found myself being able to read opponents' moves and react in time. Amazed me that concentrated environment could boost people's performance so much and so suddenly (I went back to solo queue and I became the average silver guy again)."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"In that short period, I was truly confident in my skill, believing that if I'm able to keep that level of performance, there won't be obstacles in solo queue.
