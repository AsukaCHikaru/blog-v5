Let alone who would want to create a team for a silver/ gold guy? Like for players lower than diamond/ master, you don't even qualify to compete. And clash is precisely the answer to that."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"plain","text":"With clash you can easily enjoy a tournament with a clear format and schedule, and everyone can join.
